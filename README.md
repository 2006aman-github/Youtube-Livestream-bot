# How do i get the id of my live stream?
YouTube URLs look something like this => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_jWHffIx5E
Then L_jWHffIx5E :white_check_mark: would be the ID of the video , not watch?v=L_jWHffIx5E :x:

# How many views can I send?
it depends on the power of the pc that the program is running ,important things to take into account (ram) (internet speed)

# Recommendations for use
Download all files from the repository for smooth operation
Open with administrator permissions
I do not recommend using it on the PC that is streaming live
